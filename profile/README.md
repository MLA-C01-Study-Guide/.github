## Understanding the MLA-C01 Exam

The **MLA-C01 exam** tests your ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning solutions on AWS. It focuses on four key domains:

- **Data Engineering (20%)** – Preparing and processing data for ML.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (24%)** – Understanding data, statistical analysis, and visualization.  
- **Modeling (36%)** – Selecting, training, tuning, and evaluating ML models.  
- **Machine Learning Implementation and Operations (20%)** – Deploying models, monitoring performance, and scaling solutions.

Understanding the **domain weightage** helps you prioritize your study effectively.

## Recommended Study Materials

A strong preparation plan involves **reliable study resources**:

- **AWS Official Documentation & Whitepapers**: Start with [AWS Machine Learning Specialty Exam Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/).  
- **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and A Cloud Guru provide focused ML courses.  
- **Books**: “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” is highly recommended for practical knowledge.  
- **Practice Questions**: Use resources like **[exam practice](https://www.amazon-dumps.com/)** for structured practice questions and simulated tests.

> ⚠️ Note: Stick to educational guides and practice questions. Avoid using real exam dumps to stay safe and compliant with AWS rules.
